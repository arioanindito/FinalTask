# Developing Software Sytem Final Task

This is my final project for Developing Software System module.
In order to run the project, please change the string connection to your own server. (I'm using SQLEXPRESS)
I uploaded my updated database within this project, named Ario_Final.bak
Please restore my backup database to your database server. It contains all the necessery data such as User Role, User Database, seed, etc.

If something happend and you cannot restore the backup database, you could use migration that I already provide.
Just please be aware after doing the migration, please input these necessery data manually (since I'm not put a seed function):
